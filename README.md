The game should be implemented with 2 players for a single game. The second player
should be implemented as a computer bot.
The game rules are the following:
- Standard deck of 52 cards
- 1 card per user per deal/game
- Random card dealing
- The highest card wins
- In case if the cards are equal, no one wins
Technical details:
- Use git to commit your work
- Commit at often as possible and push at least once a day
- Function body should not exceed 30 LOC
- Class should not exceed 200 LOC
- Stick to DRY principles
- Base your implementation on design patterns
- Layout should be responsive
- Use https://deckofcardsapi.com/ and Piles iz API
- Implementation should be based one React and Redux-thunk
Advanced requirements:
- Use only pure functional components
- Implement custom app bootstrap process with extendable reducer in the future
- Implement game animations for dealing, drawing, player turn
